1. get the second highest salary among all employees: \
select max(salary) from employee \
order by salary desc \
limit 1  \
where salary NOT IN ( \
select max(salary) from exmployee) \
Otherwise: \
select max(salary) from employee \
where salary <> ( \
select max(salary) from employee

2. How can we retrieve alternate records from a table in oracle? \
**functions: rownum()  mod()** \
to get even number records: \
select * from (select rownum, id, name from employee) \
where mod(rownum,2)=0

3. find max salary and department name from each department \  
select d.name, max(e.salary) as max_salary from Department d left outer join employee e \
on e.depid = d.id \
group by d.name

4. find records in table a that are not in table b without using NOT IN operator \
select * from a \
**Minus** \
select * from b \

5. In sql, null cannot be compared with itself. Therefore, null =  null is not true. We can compare null with a 
non-null value to check whether a value **is null**

6. find employees having the same name and email: **find duplicates**  
select name, count(*) from employee \
group by name, email \
**having** count(*) >1 \

7. find max salary from each department
select depid, max(salary) from department \
group by depid

8. get the nth hghest salary among all employees
* use subquery: 
select max(salary) from employee \
where salary NOT IN (select salary from employee order by salary desc limit n-1) \

9. find 10 employees with odd number as employee id \
select id from employee \
where mod(id, 2) != 0 \
limit 10 \
select id from employee \
where id%2 =1 and rownum<11

10. get the names of employees whose date of birth is between 01/01/1990 to 31/21/2000 \
select name from employee \
where dob **between** '01/01/1990' **and** '31/12/2000'

11. get the **quarter** from date \
select **to_char**(**to_date**('3/31/2006', 'M/DD/YYYY'),'Q') AS quarter \
from dual

12. find employees with duplicate email \
select name, count(email) as cnt from employee \
group by name \
**having** cnt>1

13.  find all employeees whose name contains the word 'Rich' regardless of the case \
select name from employee
where lower(name) like 'rich'

14. is it safe to use **Rowid** to locate a record i Oracle SQL?

15. what is pseudocolumn? \
Rowid and rownum are two popular pseudocolumns

16. what are the reasons for denormalizing the data? \
For better performance especially when we join tables

17. what is the feature in sql for writing if/else statements? \
**case**

18. the difference between **delete** and **truncate**? \
Delete: data manipulation language; Delete one or more rows; after delete we have to issue **commit** or **rollback** to confirm changes
truncate: data definition language: delete all the rows; no need to **commit** and changes done cannot be rolled back.

19. what is the difference among ddl and dml? \
ddl: create and define the data; (create,alter, drop, truncate,rename); need **commit**; since each ddl is permanent, we cannot run multiple ddl statements in a group like **Transaction**; After ddl, no triggers are fired; 
dml: manage the data; (select,  insert, delete, update, merge, call); no need **commit**; after dml, relevant triggers are fired;

20. why do we use escape characterss in sql queries? \
some characters like '&' has meaning in sql

21. the difference between unique key and foreign key? \
number \
null value \
unique identifier \
changes \
usage \

22. what is the difference between inner join and outer join? \

23. the difference between left outer join and right outer join? \

24. what is the data type for rowid? \
string 

25. the difference between where and having? \

26. what is the cardinality in sql? \
in sql, cardinality is the uniquenesss of data valuesin a column. if cardinality is low, then a column will have more duplicated values

27.  ** merge** statement: \
28. ** union ** and **union all**:

29. when we do **select**, we get null value also.

30. alias cannot be used in **where** clause.

31. **where** clause doesn't automatically conditioned on **Null** values

32. what is the use of execution plan in sql?

33. select * from a, b return len(a) * len(b) records. **Cartesian product**

34. switch \
Update employee **SET** deptid = case deptid when 2 then 1 when 1 then 2

35. get employee name, manager id and number of employees in the department. \
**self join** \
with d_count as ( \
select deptid, count(*) as d_count \
from employee \
group by deptno) \
select e.name as employee_name, \
m.name as Manager_name, dc.d_count as dept_count \
from employee e, \
d_count dc, \
employee m \
where e.deptid = dc.deptid and e.mgrid = m.id

36. find duplicate rows in a database \
**ask the duplicate criteria** \
use **group by** then **count()**

37. delete duplicates: \
oracle: use **rowid**

delete from table a\
where a.rowid > \
any( select b.rowid from table b \
where a.column_1 = b.column_1 \
and \
a.column_2 = b.column_2)
